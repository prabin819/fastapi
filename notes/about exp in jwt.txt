about exp
    
    here to_encode.update({"exp": expire}) is just the info on the payload, right? or it really sets the expiration of the token to that time

Excellent question ‚Äî and you're absolutely right to be curious.

‚úÖ Short Answer:
Yes, this line:

python
Copy
Edit
to_encode.update({"exp": expire})
is just setting the "exp" field in the JWT payload.

But ‚Äî and here‚Äôs the key ‚Äî when you later call:

python
Copy
Edit
jwt.encode(to_encode, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
the JWT library (python-jose) treats "exp" as a special claim and uses it to set the actual expiration of the token.

üîç Behind the scenes:
python-jose (and the JWT spec) recognizes certain standard claims like:

"exp" ‚Äì expiration time

"nbf" ‚Äì not before

"iat" ‚Äì issued at

"sub" ‚Äì subject (often user ID)

These claims aren‚Äôt just arbitrary ‚Äî they are used during verification.

So, even though you're just adding a key to a dictionary:

python
Copy
Edit
{"sub": "user@example.com", "exp": <datetime>}
When jwt.decode() is later called, it will automatically check:

python
Copy
Edit
if current_time > payload["exp"]:
    raise ExpiredSignatureError
‚úÖ So in effect:
You control token expiration by setting "exp" in the payload.

The JWT library enforces expiration when decoding/verifying.

Bonus Tip:
To avoid issues, make sure "exp" is either:

A Unix timestamp (number of seconds since epoch), or

A datetime object that the JWT library knows how to convert (which python-jose does correctly with aware datetimes).
