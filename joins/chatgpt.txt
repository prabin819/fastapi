explain joins and their types in db


ChatGPT said:
In databases, joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. This is crucial for relational databases where data is often split into multiple related tables to maintain normalization.

✅ What is a JOIN?
A JOIN clause allows you to retrieve data from multiple tables as if the data were in one table, based on a logical relationship (usually a foreign key).

🔗 Types of Joins
There are mainly 5 types of joins:

1. ✅ INNER JOIN (also called JOIN)
Returns only the matching rows from both tables.

If no match is found, that row is excluded from the result.

📌 Syntax:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT *
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.id = table2.fk_id;
📊 Result:
Only rows where table1.id = table2.fk_id

2. 🟩 LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows from the left table, and the matching rows from the right.

If there's no match, NULLs are shown for the right table.

📌 Syntax:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT *
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.id = table2.fk_id;
📊 Result:
All table1 rows, with matched table2 data or NULLs.

3. 🟥 RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows from the right table, and the matching rows from the left.

If no match, NULLs are shown for the left table.

📌 Syntax:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT *
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.id = table2.fk_id;
📊 Result:
All table2 rows, with matched table1 data or NULLs.

4. 🟦 FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows when there's a match in either table.

Non-matching rows get NULLs in missing columns.

📌 Syntax:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT *
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.id = table2.fk_id;
📊 Result:
All rows from both tables, matched or not.

5. 🟨 CROSS JOIN
Returns Cartesian product: every row of the first table is combined with every row of the second table.

Usually used when you want all possible combinations.

📌 Syntax:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT *
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
📊 Result:
If table1 has 3 rows and table2 has 4 rows → 12 total rows

🧠 Example
Tables:
Students

id	name
1	Alice
2	Bob

Marks

id	student_id	score
1	1	85
2	2	90
3	3	75

INNER JOIN result:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name, score
FROM Students
JOIN Marks ON Students.id = Marks.student_id;
name	score
Alice	85
Bob	90

(No student with ID = 3 in Students table, so that row is excluded)

Summary Table:
Join Type	Left Table Rows	Right Table Rows	Nulls?
INNER JOIN	Matched only	Matched only	❌
LEFT JOIN	All	Matched only	NULLs in right
RIGHT JOIN	Matched only	All	NULLs in left
FULL JOIN	All	All	NULLs in both
CROSS JOIN	All combinations	All combinations	❌

Great! Here's a full explanation of all types of SQL joins with examples using simple tables.

🔍 Let's define two tables:
🧾 employees table:
id	name	department_id
1	Alice	10
2	Bob	20
3	Charlie	NULL
4	David	40

🧾 departments table:
id	dept_name
10	HR
20	Engineering
30	Sales

1. ✅ INNER JOIN
📌 Query:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
📊 Result:

name	dept_name
Alice	HR
Bob	Engineering

✅ Only rows with matching department_id in both tables are returned.

2. 🟩 LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)
📌 Query:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
📊 Result:

name	dept_name
Alice	HR
Bob	Engineering
Charlie	NULL
David	NULL

✅ All rows from employees, even if there's no matching department (returns NULLs).

3. 🟥 RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
📌 Query:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
📊 Result:

name	dept_name
Alice	HR
Bob	Engineering
NULL	Sales

✅ All rows from departments, even if there's no matching employee (returns NULLs).

4. 🟦 FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)
📌 Query:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
📊 Result:

name	dept_name
Alice	HR
Bob	Engineering
Charlie	NULL
David	NULL
NULL	Sales

✅ Combines LEFT JOIN + RIGHT JOIN, includes all rows from both sides.

5. 🟨 CROSS JOIN
📌 Query:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
CROSS JOIN departments;
📊 Result:

name	dept_name
Alice	HR
Alice	Engineering
Alice	Sales
Bob	HR
Bob	Engineering
Bob	Sales
Charlie	HR
Charlie	Engineering
Charlie	Sales
David	HR
David	Engineering
David	Sales

✅ Every row from employees is combined with every row from departments.

6. 🎯 SELF JOIN (Bonus)
Used to join a table with itself.

Let’s say we want to find employees and their managers. The table:

🧾 staff table:
id	name	manager_id
1	Alice	NULL
2	Bob	1
3	Charlie	1
4	David	2

📌 Query:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT e.name AS employee, m.name AS manager
FROM staff e
LEFT JOIN staff m ON e.manager_id = m.id;
📊 Result:

employee	manager
Alice	NULL
Bob	Alice
Charlie	Alice
David	Bob

✅ A self-join helps in hierarchical data like org charts.

🧠 Summary Table
Type	Matches Only	Includes All Left	Includes All Right	All Rows	Cartesian Product
INNER JOIN	✅	❌	❌	❌	❌
LEFT JOIN	✅	✅	❌	❌	❌
RIGHT JOIN	✅	❌	✅	❌	❌
FULL JOIN	✅	✅	✅	✅	❌
CROSS JOIN	❌	❌	❌	❌	✅
SELF JOIN	✅	✅ (on same table)	✅ (on same table)	✅	❌
